## Lyrics

```
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no, no hope

no hope no hope - nigga
no hope no hope no hope - nigga (nigga)
no hope no hope no hope - nigga
no hope no hope no hope - niggaaaaaa

stacking that salt (sick of myself)
life isn't fair
i should know that 
you better run
out of my way
thoughts are apart
just like the rax (just for the drugs)
ey yo ey

stacking it all
breaching the sphere
eternal mist 
fucking the endless 
this is so real
this is surreal


no hope no hope no hope no hope

no no no noooou

maybe i'll just fucking  go away

- aye

FLUID TRIPLET RAP BELOW

i need to stay
i need to stay
it's just my way

stuck to the rax

stacking that salt
life isn't fair
i should know that
you better run
out of my way
thoughts are apart
just like the rax
ey yo ey

stacking it all
breaching the sphere
eternal mist 
fucking  the endless 
this is so real
this is surreal

x
x
x
x
you got nothing to object

no hope no hope no hope


```
