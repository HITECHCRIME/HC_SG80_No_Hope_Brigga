## Lyrics

```
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no hope
no, no hope

no hope no hope - nigga
no hope no hope no hope - nigga (nigga)
no hope no hope no hope - nigga
no hope no hope no hope - niggaaaaaa

stacking that salt
life isn't fair
i should know that
you better run
out of my way
thoughts are apart
just like the rax
ey yo ey

stacking it all
breaching the sphere
eternal mist 
fucking  the endless 
this is so real
this is surreal

just go away

- aye



i need to stay
it's just my way


```
